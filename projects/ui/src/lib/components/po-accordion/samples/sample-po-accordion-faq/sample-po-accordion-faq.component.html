    <po-accordion-item p-label="Who can donate?" #questionOne>
      In principle, we can say that we can all apply for blood donation. However, our acceptance depends on compliance
      with current legislation and a number of factors that take into account the risk that such a donation may pose to
      the health of the candidate himself and to the health of the individual receiving the donated blood.

    <po-accordion-item p-label="Is donating blood safe?">
      Yes, donating blood is safe. There is no risk of getting an infectious disease by donating blood. However, there
      is a small risk that the donor may feel unwell during or shortly after the donation especially the first few times
      he or she donates, but the services are concerned about this, watching and making sure the donors feel nothing or
      feel feel so that they are well assisted until full recovery.
